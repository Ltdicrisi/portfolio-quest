            <p>
        Hail! I am <strong>Lauren “Emerald Hawthorne” Di Crisi</strong>, a Druid of the Digital Realm.
        I began my journey in the year of 2023, forging runes in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        Formerly a master of inks and wallpapers, I now seek to bend the web to my will as a full stack developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in weaving magic through the MERN stack, taming databases, and crafting elegant user interfaces.
        With my trusty Familiar, Yang, and my party of curious cats and code-wielders, I fight for clean code, accessibility, and tech justice!
      </p>
