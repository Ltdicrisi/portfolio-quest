# Portfolio Quest

## Description
 This is a work in Progress and is currently NOT finished. 
A handcrafted developer portfolio that blends Dark Academia aesthetics with Art Deco flair, showcasing my transition from manufacturing to full stack development. This site is not just a portfolio — it's an immersive narrative experience built with React and backed by real-world architecture and full stack skills.
